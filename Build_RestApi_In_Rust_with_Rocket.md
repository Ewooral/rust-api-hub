Ewooral: lets start building our api service in rust with rocket

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's start by setting up a new Rust project and adding the necessary dependencies.

1. Create a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new rocket_api
cd rocket_api
```

2. Open `Cargo.toml` and add the following dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket = "0.4.10"
rocket_contrib = "0.4.10"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

3. Now, let's create a simple Rocket server. Open `src/main.rs` and replace its content with:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![index]).launch();
}
```

This code creates a new Rocket application, mounts a single route (the index route) at the path "/", and launches the application.

4. Run the server:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should now have a basic Rocket server running at `localhost:8000`. When you navigate to that URL in your web browser, you should see the text "Hello, world!".

Remember to use nightly Rust because Rocket requires it. You can set it as default with `rustup default nightly` or use it only for your project with `rustup override set nightly`.

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the Rocket framework requires a nightly version of Rust. You can set the nightly version for your project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

After setting the nightly version, try to run your project again with `cargo run`.

Ewooral: now, my rust server is working locally. how do i host it on amazon ec2 instance

GitHub Copilot: Hosting your Rust application on an Amazon EC2 instance involves several steps:

1. **Create an EC2 instance**: Log into your AWS Management Console, go to the EC2 dashboard, and create a new instance. Choose an appropriate instance type (t2.micro is sufficient for small applications and is free tier eligible). Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) that has Rust installed, or you can choose a basic Linux AMI and install Rust manually.

2. **SSH into your EC2 instance**: Once your instance is running, you can SSH into it using the key pair that you specified when creating the instance. The command will look something like this:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address
```

3. **Install Rust (if not already installed)**: If your AMI didn't come with Rust pre-installed, you can install it with the following commands:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

4. **Copy your project to the EC2 instance**: You can use `scp` (secure copy) to transfer your project files to the EC2 instance. From your local machine, run:

```bash
scp -i /path/to/your/key.pem -r /path/to/your/project ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address:/home/ec2-user/
```

5. **Build and run your project on the EC2 instance**: SSH back into your EC2 instance, navigate to your project directory, and build and run your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

6. **Configure a security group**: In the EC2 dashboard, create a new security group for your instance that allows incoming traffic on the port your application is running on.

7. **Access your application**: You should now be able to access your application by navigating to `http://your-ec2-ip-address:your-port` in your web browser.

Remember to replace `/path/to/your/key.pem` with the path to your actual PEM key, `ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address` with your actual EC2 user and IP address, and `/path/to/your/project` with the path to your actual project.

ERROR: Permission to Ewooral/rust-api-with-rocket.git denied to DawsonTheFanteGuy.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.


GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the Git user `DawsonTheFanteGuy` does not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository `Ewooral/rust-api-with-rocket.git`.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Check your Git user**: Make sure you're using the correct Git account. You can check the current Git user with these commands:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

If you need to change the Git user, you can do so with these commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

2. **Check your SSH keys**: If the repository uses SSH, make sure your SSH key is added to the SSH agent, and that the public key is added to your GitHub account. You can check which keys are currently being used by the SSH agent with `ssh-add -l`.

3. **Check repository permissions**: If you're sure you're using the correct Git user and SSH key, you may not have the necessary permissions for the repository. If you're not the owner of the repository, you may need to ask the owner to add you as a collaborator or to give you the necessary permissions.

4. **Check the remote URL**: Make sure you're pushing to the correct remote URL. You can check the current remote URL with `git remote -v`. If the remote URL is incorrect, you can change it with `git remote set-url origin your.git.url`.

Remember to replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual name and email, and "your.git.url" with your actual Git URL.

Ewooral: yeah I am using account name ewooral and email boahen.cos@gmail.com so i don't know where dawsonthe... is oming from

GitHub Copilot: It seems like your Git is configured with a different account. You can change the Git user for the current repository (not globally) with these commands:

```bash
git config user.name "ewooral"
git config user.email "boahen.cos@gmail.com"
```

After setting the username and email, try to push again:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If you're still having issues, it's possible that the SSH key associated with the `DawsonTheFanteGuy` account is being used. You might need to generate a new SSH key and add it to your `ewooral` GitHub account.

Here's how you can do that:

1. Generate a new SSH key (replace the email with your email):

```bash


ssh

-keygen -t ed25519 -C "boahen.cos@gmail.com"
```

2. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

3. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.

4. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

5. Add the new SSH key to your GitHub account. You can copy the SSH key to your clipboard with:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
```

Then, go to the GitHub website, open the account settings, go to SSH and GPG keys, and add a new SSH key. Paste your key into the "Key" field.

After adding the new SSH key to your GitHub account, try to push again.

error: could not compile `typenum` (build script) due to 1 previous error


GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the C compiler (`cc`) is not found, which is required for building some Rust dependencies.

You can install the C compiler and other necessary build tools by installing the `build-essential` package. If you're using a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), you can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

After installing `build-essential`, try to build your project again with `cargo build`.

If you're using a different Linux distribution, the command to install `build-essential` might be different. For example, on a CentOS/RHEL system, you would use `sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'`.

Ewooral: so with the below which should i change
scp -i /path/to/your/key.pem -r /path/to/your/project ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address:/home/ec2-user/

GitHub Copilot: You should replace the placeholders in the command with the actual paths and values:

- `/path/to/your/key.pem`: This should be replaced with the path to your private key file that you use to connect to your EC2 instance. This is the `.pem` file that you downloaded when you created the EC2 instance.

- `/path/to/your/project`: This should be replaced with the path to the directory of your Rust project on your local machine.

- `ec2-user@your-ec2-ip-address`: This should be replaced with your actual EC2 username and the public IP address of your EC2 instance. The default username for Amazon Linux instances is `ec2-user`, and you can find the public IP address of your instance in the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

So, if your key is located at `~/mykey.pem`, your project is in `~/myprojects/myrustproject`, and your EC2 IP address is `54.123.45.67`, the command would look like this:

```bash
scp -i ~/mykey.pem -r ~/myprojects/myrustproject ec2-user@54.123.45.67:/home/ec2-user/

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that the permissions for your private key file (`ewooral.pem`) are too open. For security reasons, SSH requires that your private key file is only readable by you.

You tried to change the permissions with `chmod 400 ewooral.pem`, which is the correct command, but it failed with "Operation not permitted". This error typically occurs when you don't have the necessary permissions to change the file.

Since you're using `sudo` for the `scp` command, it seems like you might not be the owner of the `ewooral.pem` file. You can change the ownership of the file to your user with the following command:

```bash
sudo chown $USER:$USER ewooral.pem
```

After changing the ownership, try to change the permissions again:

```bash
chmod 400 ewooral.pem
```

Then, try the `scp` command again. If you're still having issues, make sure that you're in the correct directory and that the `ewooral.pem` file is in that directory. You can check this with `ls -l`.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "error in libcrypto" suggests that there might be an issue with the version of OpenSSL on your system. 

However, the more pressing issue seems to be that the EC2 instance is still denying permission. This usually means that the public key corresponding to the private key you're using (`ewooral.pem`) is not present in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the EC2 instance.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Is the key pair for the EC2 instance correct?** When you created the EC2 instance, you either created a new key pair or selected an existing one. Make sure that `ewooral.pem` is the private key for that key pair.

2. **Is the EC2 instance running Amazon Linux?** The username `ec2-user` is used for Amazon Linux instances. If your instance is running a different operating system, the username might be different (for example, `ubuntu` for Ubuntu instances).

3. **Is the EC2 instance's security group allowing SSH connections?** The security group for the EC2 instance needs to allow incoming SSH connections. You can check this in the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

If you're still having issues, you might need to connect to the instance using EC2 Instance Connect or Session Manager to troubleshoot the SSH configuration. This requires that the instance is configured to allow these connection methods.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Load key "ewooral.pem": error in libcrypto" suggests that there might be an issue with the OpenSSL library on your system. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a mismatch between the versions of OpenSSL and OpenSSH, or a problem with the private key file.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the version of OpenSSL and OpenSSH**: You can check the version of OpenSSL with `openssl version` and the version of OpenSSH with `ssh -V`. If the versions are not compatible, you might need to update one or both of them.

2. **Check the private key file**: Try to view the contents of the private key file with `cat ewooral.pem`. The file should start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and end with `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`. If it doesn't, the file might be corrupted or not in the correct format.

3. **Convert the private key file to the RSA format**: If the private key file is in a format that's not supported by your version of OpenSSH, you might need to convert it to the RSA format. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ewooral.pem
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase of the private key (if any), and then rewrite the private key in the RSA format.

4. **Update OpenSSL and OpenSSH**: If the versions of OpenSSL and OpenSSH are not compatible, or if there's a bug in the version you're using, you might need to update them. On a Debian-based system, you can do this with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`.

Remember to replace "ewooral.pem" with the actual path to your private key file if it's not in the current directory.

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that Rocket, the web framework you're using, doesn't recognize `debug` as a valid configuration environment. 

Rocket recognizes four configuration environments by default: `development`, `staging`, `production`, and `global`. Each environment corresponds to a section in the `Rocket.toml` configuration file.

In your `Rocket.toml` file, you have a section for `debug`, which is not one of the four recognized environments. That's why Rocket is giving an error when you try to run the application with `cargo run release`.

If you want to use a `debug` configuration, you should rename it to `development` in your `Rocket.toml` file:

```toml
[development]
port = 8000

[release]
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000
```

Then, you can run the application in development mode with `cargo run`. If you want to run it in release mode, you can use `cargo run --release`.

The warning about the `traitobject` package is unrelated to the Rocket configuration. It's saying that the `traitobject` package contains code that will be rejected by a future version of Rust. You can see more details about this by running `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1`.

Ewooral:  Running `target/release/rust_rocket_api`
Error: [release] is not a known configuration environment

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that Rocket is not recognizing `release` as a valid configuration environment. This is unusual because `release` is one of the four default environments (`development`, `staging`, `production`, `global`) that Rocket should recognize.

This issue might be due to a version mismatch. Rocket 0.4 and earlier versions do not support the `release` environment. If you're using Rocket 0.4 or earlier, you should use `production` instead of `release`.

Here's how you can modify your `Rocket.toml` file:

```toml
[development]
port = 8000

[production]
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000
```

Then, you can run the application in production mode with `cargo run --release`.

If you're using Rocket 0.5 or later and still encountering this issue, it might be a bug or a configuration issue. In that case, you might want to check the Rocket documentation or ask for help in the Rocket community.

Ewooral: lets create an endpoint with route name greet that takes greeting type and name  parameter sand response  "Good "Greeting parameter, name"

GitHub Copilot: To create an endpoint in Rocket that takes parameters, you can use dynamic segments in the route attribute. Here's how you can create a `greet` endpoint that takes a `greeting` and a `name` parameter:

First, add the route to your main function:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/", routes![greet])
}
```

In this code:

- `#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]` defines a GET route at `/greet/<greeting>/<name>`. The `<greeting>` and `<name>` parts are dynamic segments that match any string.
- `fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String` is the handler function for the route. It takes two parameters, `greeting` and `name`, which correspond to the dynamic segments in the route.
- `format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)` returns a string that includes the `greeting` and `name` parameters.
- `rocket::build().mount("/", routes![greet])` mounts the `greet` route at the root path (`/`).

With this code, if you navigate to `/greet/Evening/John`, the server will respond with `Good Evening, John`.

Ewooral: update our main.rs code below with the new endpoint above
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![index]).launch();
}

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can update your `main.rs` file to include the new `greet` endpoint:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![index, greet]).launch();
}
```

In this code:

- `#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]` defines a GET route at `/greet/<greeting>/<name>`. The `<greeting>` and `<name>` parts are dynamic segments that match any string.
- `fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String` is the handler function for the route. It takes two parameters, `greeting` and `name`, which correspond to the dynamic segments in the route.
- `format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)` returns a string that includes the `greeting` and `name` parameters.
- `rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![index, greet]).launch();` mounts the `index` and `greet` routes at the root path (`/`).

With this code, if you navigate to `/greet/Evening/John`, the server will respond with `Good Evening, John`.

Ewooral: lets create Nginx Configuration as a reverse proxy server for our rust to be able to run non stop on aws instance ec2

GitHub Copilot: To use Nginx as a reverse proxy for your Rust application, you'll first need to install Nginx on your EC2 instance. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Once Nginx is installed, you can create a new Nginx configuration file for your application. Here's a basic example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_IP;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # Replace with the port your Rust app is running on
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

This configuration sets up a new server block that listens on port 80 (the default HTTP port). It forwards all incoming requests to `localhost:8000`, which should be replaced with the port your Rust application is running on.

You can save this configuration in a new file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory, for example `/etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp`.

Then, you can enable the configuration by creating a symbolic link to it in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Finally, you can test the configuration and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Now, Nginx should be running as a reverse proxy for your Rust application. You can access your application at your EC2 instance's public IP address or domain name (if you have one).

Ewooral: can rust endpoint be tested with thunder client

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can definitely use Thunder Client to test your Rust endpoints. Thunder Client is a REST API Client for Visual Studio Code, similar to Postman but integrated directly into your IDE.

Here's a basic step-by-step guide on how to use Thunder Client to test your Rust endpoint:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. If you haven't installed Thunder Client yet, go to the Extensions view (the square icon on the left sidebar), search for "Thunder Client", and install it.
3. Click on the Thunder Client icon in the left sidebar to open it.
4. Click on the "New Request" button.
5. Enter the URL of your Rust endpoint in the URL field. For example, if your Rust server is running on `localhost` port `8000` and you have a `greet` endpoint that takes `greeting` and `name` parameters, you might enter `http://localhost:8000/greet/Hello/John`.
6. Select the appropriate HTTP method from the dropdown next to the URL field. If your `greet` endpoint is a GET endpoint, select "GET".
7. Click on the "Send" button to send the request.
8. The response from your Rust server will appear in the pane below the request.

Remember to replace `http://localhost:8000/greet/Hello/John` with the actual URL of your Rust endpoint.

Ewooral: so lets test our above endpoints with the actual aws url below
http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can test your Rust endpoints running on your AWS EC2 instance using Thunder Client in Visual Studio Code. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Thunder Client icon in the left sidebar to open it.
3. Click on the "New Request" button.
4. Enter the URL of your Rust endpoint in the URL field. For example, if you have a `greet` endpoint that takes `greeting` and `name` parameters, you might enter `http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/greet/Hello/John`.
5. Select the appropriate HTTP method from the dropdown next to the URL field. If your `greet` endpoint is a GET endpoint, select "GET".
6. Click on the "Send" button to send the request.
7. The response from your Rust server will appear in the pane below the request.

Remember to replace `http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/greet/Hello/John` with the actual URL of your Rust endpoint. If your server is set up correctly and your application is running, you should see the response from your Rust application in the response pane.

Ewooral: but why is it that when I close from my ec2 ubuntu shell, the server goes off, how do i make it work without initliazing the server through the ec2 ubuntu terminal like how pm2 works with node

GitHub Copilot: When you start a process in a terminal, it's tied to that terminal session. When you close the terminal, the system sends a SIGHUP (hangup) signal to the process, causing it to terminate.

To keep your Rust server running after you close the terminal, you can use a tool like `nohup` or `screen`.

Here's how you can use `nohup`:

1. Start your server with `nohup`:

```bash
nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1 &
```

This command will start your server and redirect both standard output and standard error to `output.log`. The `&` at the end runs the process in the background.

2. If you want to stop the server, you can use the `kill` command with the process ID. You can find the process ID with the `ps` command:

```bash
ps aux | grep cargo
```

Here's how you can use `screen`:

1. Start a new `screen` session:

```bash
screen -S rust_server
```

2. In the `screen` session, start your server:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

3. Press `Ctrl-A` followed by `D` to detach from the `screen` session.

4. If you want to reattach to the session, you can use the `screen -r` command:

```bash
screen -r rust_server
```

Both `nohup` and `screen` are available on most Linux distributions. If they're not installed on your EC2 instance, you can install them with `sudo apt-get install nohup` or `sudo apt-get install screen`.

Ewooral: so even if i turn off my pc will someone from a different country be able to access my api endpoint

GitHub Copilot: Yes, as long as your Rust application is running on a server (like an AWS EC2 instance), and that server is accessible over the internet, anyone from anywhere in the world can access your API endpoint, regardless of whether your personal computer is turned on or off.

When you run your application on a server, it's independent of your local machine. The server will continue to run your application even if you disconnect from it or turn off your personal computer.

However, please note that for your API to be accessible:

1. The server must be running and connected to the internet.
2. The application must be running on the server.
3. The server's firewall (if any) must allow incoming connections to the port your application is running on.
4. The person trying to access your API must know the correct URL and port number.

If you've set up everything correctly, your API should be accessible from anywhere.

Ewooral: so how doi make the server available on the internet

GitHub Copilot: Your AWS EC2 instance should already be accessible over the internet, but there are a few things you need to check to ensure that your Rust application is accessible:

1. **Security Group Rules:** AWS uses security groups as a firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances. You need to ensure that your security group allows inbound traffic on the port your application is running on. You can do this in the AWS Management Console:

   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click on "Security Groups" under "Network & Security".
   - Find the security group that's associated with your EC2 instance.
   - Select the "Inbound rules" tab and click "Edit inbound rules".
   - Add a new rule with the following settings: Type: Custom TCP, Protocol: TCP, Port Range: the port your application is running on, Source: Anywhere or the specific IP range you want to allow.
   - Click "Save rules".

2. **Application is Running:** Make sure your Rust application is running on your EC2 instance. You can use `nohup` or `screen` to keep your application running even after you close the terminal, as I explained in a previous message.

3. **Nginx Configuration:** If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy, make sure it's configured correctly to forward requests to your Rust application. The `proxy_pass` directive should point to `http://localhost:your_app_port`.

4. **Domain Name (Optional):** If you want to access your application using a domain name instead of an IP address, you'll need to register a domain name and set up DNS records to point to your EC2 instance's public IP address. You can do this through a domain registrar like Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, or Namecheap.

After you've checked all these things, your Rust application should be accessible over the internet. You can access it using your EC2 instance's public IP address (or domain name, if you set one up) and the port your application is running on.

Ewooral: so how do i test to see that my server is online with nohup

GitHub Copilot: You can check if your server is running by using the `ps` command to list running processes and `grep` to filter for your server process.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal on your EC2 instance.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
ps aux | grep cargo
```

This command will list all running processes (`ps aux`), then filter for lines that contain the word "cargo" (`grep cargo`). If your server is running, you should see it in the output.

You can also check the `output.log` file that you specified when you started your server with `nohup`. This file contains the standard output and standard error of your server. If your server is running, it might be logging messages to this file.

To view the contents of `output.log`, you can use the `cat` command:

```bash
cat output.log
```

If your server is running and accessible over the internet, you should also be able to access your API endpoints using a tool like curl, wget, or a web browser. For example, if your server is running on port 8000 and you have an endpoint at `/`, you can try accessing `http://your_ec2_public_ip:8000/`.

Ewooral: ubuntu     21218  0.0  0.2   7076  2176 pts/0    S+   08:39   0:00 grep --color=auto cargo


GitHub Copilot: The output you're seeing is not your running Rust application, but the `grep` command you just ran. When you run `ps aux | grep cargo`, the `grep` command is included in the `ps` output, which can be a bit confusing.

To avoid this, you can add a small trick to your command: `ps aux | grep [c]argo`. This will exclude the `grep` command from the output.

```bash
ps aux | grep [c]argo
```

If your Rust application is running, you should see it in the output of this command. If you don't see your application, it's not running. In that case, you should start it again with the `nohup` command:

```bash
nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1 &
```

Remember to check the `output.log` file for any error messages or logs from your application.

Ewooral: nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1 &
[3] 21227
[2]   Exit 101                nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1


GitHub Copilot: The message `Exit 101` indicates that the `cargo run --release` command exited with an error. The exit code `101` is a common exit code for Rust programs that have panicked.

To find out what went wrong, you should check the `output.log` file. This file contains the standard output and standard error of your `cargo run --release` command. You can view the contents of this file with the `cat` command:

```bash
cat output.log
```

This should display any error messages or logs from your application. These messages can help you diagnose the problem. For example, your application might be unable to bind to the specified port, or there might be a problem with your application's code.

[3]+  Exit 101                nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1


GitHub Copilot: The error message "Address already in use (os error 98)" indicates that another process is already using port 8000, which is the port your Rust application is trying to bind to.

You can use the `lsof` command to find out which process is using port 8000:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8000
```

This command will list all processes that are using network connections on port 8000. The PID column shows the process ID of each process.

Once you've identified the process that's using port 8000, you can stop it with the `kill` command:

```bash
sudo kill -9 PID
```

Replace `PID` with the process ID you found with the `lsof` command.

After you've stopped the other process, you should be able to start your Rust application again with the `nohup` command:

```bash
nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1 &
```

If you still see the "Address already in use" error after doing this, it's possible that your Rust application is still running in the background. In that case, you should stop your Rust application before trying to start it again. You can find the process ID of your Rust application with the `ps` command, as I explained in a previous message.

Ewooral: COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
rust_rock 21210 ubuntu    3u  IPv4  79192      0t0  TCP *:8000 (LISTEN)


GitHub Copilot: The output from the `lsof` command shows that a process named `rust_rock` with the process ID (PID) 21210 is currently listening on port 8000.

You can stop this process with the `kill` command:

```bash
sudo kill -9 21210
```

After running this command, the `rust_rock` process should be stopped, and port 8000 should be free. You can then try starting your Rust application again with the `nohup` command:

```bash
nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1 &
```

If you run the `lsof` command again after doing this, you should see your new Rust application process listening on port 8000.

Ewooral: so now even if i close my cloud terminal and turn off my pc, my endpoints will be live?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, if you started your Rust application with the `nohup` command and it's running successfully, it will continue to run even if you close your terminal or turn off your PC. The `nohup` command allows the process to keep running in the background independently of the terminal.

However, remember that your application will only be accessible over the internet if the following conditions are met:

1. The AWS EC2 instance is running and connected to the internet.
2. The security group rules for the EC2 instance allow inbound traffic on the port your application is running on.
3. If you're using a domain name to access your application, the DNS records are correctly set up to point to your EC2 instance's public IP address.

You can test if your application is accessible by trying to access one of your API endpoints from a different machine. Use the public IP address of your EC2 instance and the port your application is running on. For example, if your application is running on port 8000 and you have an endpoint at `/`, you can try accessing `http://your_ec2_public_ip:8000/`.

Ewooral: so how can we access our endpoints in a simple next js app

GitHub Copilot: To access your API endpoints in a Next.js application, you can use the `fetch` function, which is built into modern browsers. Here's an example:

```javascript
fetch('http://your_ec2_public_ip:8000/your_endpoint')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

Replace `'http://your_ec2_public_ip:8000/your_endpoint'` with the URL of your API endpoint.

This code sends a GET request to your API endpoint, then logs the response data to the console. If there's an error, it logs the error message to the console.

You can put this code in any component where you want to fetch data from your API. For example, you might put it in a `useEffect` hook in a React component, so that it runs when the component mounts:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('http://your_ec2_public_ip:8000/your_endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
  }, []);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Remember to replace `'http://your_ec2_public_ip:8000/your_endpoint'` with the URL of your API endpoint.

Ewooral: but won't there be any cors errors

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. When you make a request to a different domain, protocol, or port, you're making a cross-origin request. Browsers block these requests by default for security reasons, using a policy called the same-origin policy.

To allow cross-origin requests, your server needs to include the appropriate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers in its responses. These headers tell the browser that it's okay to allow a web application from a different origin to access the resources.

In your Rust Rocket application, you can use the `rocket_cors` crate to handle CORS. Here's an example of how to set it up:

First, add `rocket_cors` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket_cors = "0.5.2"
```

Then, configure CORS in your main function:

```rust
use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedOrigins, CorsOptions};

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let allowed_origins = AllowedOrigins::some_exact(&[
        // Add your origins here
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);

    let cors = CorsOptions::default()
        .allowed_origins(allowed_origins)
        .allowed_methods(vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect())
        .allow_credentials(true)
        .into_cors()
        .expect("error while building CORS");

    rocket::build().attach(cors).mount("/", routes![...])
}
```

Replace `"http://localhost:3000"` and `"http://your_nextjs_app_origin"` with the origins of your Next.js application. If your Next.js application is running on localhost on port 3000, you can use `"http://localhost:3000"`.

This code allows GET and POST requests from the specified origins. You can customize it to allow other HTTP methods or origins as needed.

After you've set up CORS on your server, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from your Next.js application without getting CORS errors.

Ewooral: so update our main.rs function to have this update

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you need to update your `main.rs` file to include the CORS configuration. Here's how you can do it:

First, import the necessary modules at the top of your `main.rs` file:

```rust
use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedOrigins, CorsOptions};
```

Then, in your main function (or the function where you're launching your Rocket application), add the following code to set up CORS:

```rust
#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let allowed_origins = AllowedOrigins::some_exact(&[
        // Add your origins here
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);

    let cors = CorsOptions::default()
        .allowed_origins(allowed_origins)
        .allowed_methods(vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect())
        .allow_credentials(true)
        .into_cors()
        .expect("error while building CORS");

    rocket::build().attach(cors).mount("/", routes![...])
}
```

Replace `"http://localhost:3000"` and `"http://your_nextjs_app_origin"` with the origins of your Next.js application. If your Next.js application is running on localhost on port 3000, you can use `"http://localhost:3000"`.

Also, replace `routes![...]` with your actual routes.

This code allows GET and POST requests from the specified origins. You can customize it to allow other HTTP methods or origins as needed.

After you've set up CORS on your server, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from your Next.js application without getting CORS errors.

Ewooral: below is my main.rs code,, upate it to have the cors update

#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![index, greet]).launch();
}

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's your updated `main.rs` file with the CORS configuration:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedOrigins, CorsOptions};

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let allowed_origins = AllowedOrigins::some_exact(&[
        // Add your origins here
        "http://localhost:3000",
        // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);

    let cors = CorsOptions::default()
        .allowed_origins(allowed_origins)
        .allowed_methods(vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect())
        .allow_credentials(true)
        .into_cors()
        .expect("error while building CORS");

    rocket::build().attach(cors).mount("/", routes![index, greet])
}
```

Remember to replace `"http://localhost:3000"` with the origin of your Next.js application. If your Next.js application is running on localhost on port 3000, you can use `"http://localhost:3000"`. If your Next.js application is hosted somewhere else, replace `"http://localhost:3000"` with the actual origin of your Next.js application.

This code allows GET and POST requests from the specified origins. You can customize it to allow other HTTP methods or origins as needed.

After you've set up CORS on your server, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from your Next.js application without getting CORS errors.

Ewooral: customize it to allow all http methods

GitHub Copilot: Sure, to allow all HTTP methods, you can use `Method::all()` instead of specifying each method individually. Here's your updated `main.rs` file:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedOrigins, CorsOptions};

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let allowed_origins = AllowedOrigins::some_exact(&[
        // Add your origins here
        "http://localhost:3000",
        // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);

    let cors = CorsOptions::default()
        .allowed_origins(allowed_origins)
        .allowed_methods(Method::all().into_iter().map(From::from).collect())
        .allow_credentials(true)
        .into_cors()
        .expect("error while building CORS");

    rocket::build().attach(cors).mount("/", routes![index, greet])
}
```

This code now allows all HTTP methods from the specified origins. You can still customize it to allow different origins as needed.

After you've set up CORS on your server, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from your Next.js application without getting CORS errors.

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. It seems like you're using Rocket version 0.4, while the code I provided is for Rocket version 0.5. 

Here's how you can set up CORS in Rocket 0.4:

First, add `rocket_cors` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket_cors = "0.4.0"
```

Then, update your `main.rs`:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
extern crate rocket_cors;

use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedOrigins, Cors, CorsOptions};

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

fn main() {
    let allowed_origins = AllowedOrigins::some_exact(&[
        // Add your origins here
        "http://localhost:3000",
        // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);

    let cors = CorsOptions {
        allowed_origins,
        allowed_methods: vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect(),
        allow_credentials: true,

    rocket::ignite()
        .attach(cors)
        .mount("/", routes![index, greet])
        .launch();
}
```

This code allows GET and POST requests from the specified origins. You can customize it to allow other HTTP methods or origins as needed.

After you've set up CORS on your server, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from your Next.js application without getting CORS errors.

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding about the version of `rocket_cors` you're using. Here's how you can set up CORS in Rocket 0.4 with `rocket_cors` 0.4:

First, add `rocket_cors` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket_cors = "0.4.0"
```

Then, update your `main.rs`:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
extern crate rocket_cors;

use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket::response::content;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedHeaders, AllowedOrigins, Error};

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

fn main() {
    let (allowed_origins, failed_origins) = AllowedOrigins::some(&[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);
    assert!(failed_origins.is_empty());

    let options = rocket_cors::Cors {
        allowed_origins,
        allowed_methods: vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect(),
        allowed_headers: AllowedHeaders::some(&["Authorization", "Accept"]),
       

 allow

_credentials: true,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    rocket::ignite()
        .mount("/", routes![index, greet])
        .attach(options)
        .launch();
}
```

This code allows GET and POST requests from the specified origins. You can customize it to allow other HTTP methods or origins as needed.

After you've set up CORS on your server, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from your Next.js application without getting CORS errors.

🚀 Rocket has launched from http://localhost:8000


GitHub Copilot: Great! Your Rocket server is now running and has CORS configured. It's listening on `localhost:8000` and has two routes:

- `GET /` which is handled by the `index` function and returns "Hello, world!"
- `GET /greet/<greeting>/<name>` which is handled by the `greet` function and returns a greeting message.

You can test these endpoints by visiting `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:8000/greet/Good/Morning` in your web browser, or using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

The warnings about unused imports (`rocket::response::content` and `rocket_cors::Error`) can be resolved by removing those lines, as they are not needed in your current code. 

The note about future incompatibilities is a warning that the `traitobject` crate, which is a dependency of your project, contains code that will not work in a future version of Rust. This is something the maintainers of that crate will need to address. You can run `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1` for more details.

Ewooral: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/greet/morning/Esi. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing). Status code: 200.

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the server is not sending the necessary `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response. This header is required for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and tells the browser that it's okay to load the resource from a different origin.

In your Rocket server code, you've specified `http://localhost:3000` as the allowed origin. However, it seems like you're trying to access the server from a different origin (`http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000`).

To fix this issue, you need to add this origin to the list of allowed origins in your Rocket server code. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
let (allowed_origins, failed_origins) = AllowedOrigins::some(&[
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000",
    // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
]);
```

After making this change, recompile and restart your Rocket server. Then, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from `http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000` without getting CORS errors.

Ewooral: so update my main.rs with the above update

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you need to update the `allowed_origins` in your `main.rs` to include the origin you're making requests from. Here's the updated `main.rs`:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
extern crate rocket_cors;

use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedHeaders, AllowedOrigins};

#[get("/")]

}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

fn main() {
    let (allowed_origins, failed_origins) = AllowedOrigins::some(&[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000",
        // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);
    assert!(failed_origins.is_empty());

    let options = rocket_cors::Cors {
        allowed_origins,
        allowed_methods: vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect(),
        allowed_headers: AllowedHeaders::some(&["Authorization", "Accept"]),
       

 allow

_credentials: true,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    rocket::ignite()
        .mount("/", routes![index, greet])
        .attach(options)
        .launch();
}
```

After updating the code, recompile and restart your Rocket server. Then, you should be able to make cross-origin requests from `http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000` without getting CORS errors.

Address already in use (os error 98)
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace


GitHub Copilot: The error message "Address already in use (os error 98)" indicates that the port 8000 is already being used by another process on your system. 

You have a couple of options to resolve this:

1. **Find the process using the port and stop it.** You can use the `lsof` command to find the process:

    ```bash
    sudo lsof -i :8000
    ```

    This will list all processes using port 8000. Once you've identified the process, you can stop it using the `kill` command:

    ```bash
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```

    Replace `<PID>` with the process ID from the `lsof` output.

2. **Change the port your Rocket application is using.** You can do this by updating the Rocket configuration. Create a `Rocket.toml` file in the root of your project with the following content:

    ```toml
    [production]
    address = "0.0.0.0"
    port = 8001
    ```

    This will make your application run on port 8001 instead of 8000. You can replace 8001 with any valid port number that's not currently in use.

After you've done one of these, try running your application again with `cargo run --release`.

Ewooral: how do i kill this process

rust_rock 21239 ubuntu    3u  IPv4  81324      0t0  TCP *:8000 (LISTEN)


GitHub Copilot: You can kill the process by using the `kill` command followed by the PID (Process ID). In your case, the PID is `21239`. Here's the command you would use:

```bash
kill -9 21239
```

This command sends the `SIGKILL` signal to the process with PID `21239`, effectively terminating it. After running this command, you should be able to start your Rocket application on port 8000.

Ewooral: Error: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data

GitHub Copilot: 

Ewooral: Error: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data

GitHub Copilot: This error typically occurs when you're trying to parse an empty document or a document that is not in the JSON format using `JSON.parse()`. 

Here are a few possible reasons:

1. The server returned an empty response.
2. The server returned a response in a format other than JSON (like HTML or plain text).
3. There's an error in the server-side script, and it's not returning valid JSON.

To debug this issue, you can log the response before trying to parse it. This will help you identify what's actually being returned. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch('http://your-api-url')
  .then(response => response.text())  // convert to plain text
  .then(text => {
    console.log(text);
    return JSON.parse(text);  // parse it to json
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This will print the raw response to the console, allowing you to see what's causing `JSON.parse()` to fail.

Ewooral: so if i make changes to my aws next js app code hosted on ec2 instaqnce from the instance ubuntu shell, how do i make it reflect on the hosted instance code

GitHub Copilot: If you've made changes to your Next.js application code directly on your EC2 instance, you'll need to rebuild and restart your application for the changes to take effect.

Here are the general steps you would follow:

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your Next.js project.

2. **Install any new dependencies:**

    If you've added any new dependencies, you'll need to install them using `npm` or `yarn`:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

3. **Build your Next.js application:**

    Next.js uses a build step to generate a production-ready version of your application. You can trigger this with the `build` script:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

4. **Start your Next.js application:**

    Once the build is complete, you can start your application:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    Your application should now be running with the latest changes.

Please note that these steps assume you're using a process manager like PM2 to keep your application running. If you're not, you'll need to set that up or manually restart your application whenever you make changes.

Ewooral: how about if i run it with pm2 and there is already an instance of the app running like below

pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms" --watch
[PM2] Starting /usr/bin/bash in fork_mode (1 instance)

└────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┴────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘


GitHub Copilot: If you're using PM2 and there's already an instance of the app running, you can use the `pm2 restart` command to restart the application and apply the changes. 

First, you need to stop the current running instance of your application. In your case, the name of the application is "auto-sms". You can stop it using the following command:

```bash
pm2 stop "auto-sms"
```

Then, delete the stopped process:

```bash
pm2 delete "auto-sms"
```

Now, you can start the application again with the new changes:

```bash
pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms" --watch
```

This will stop the current instance of the application, apply the changes you've made, and then start the application again. The `--watch` flag means PM2 will automatically restart your application whenever a file changes in the current directory or its subdirectories.

Ewooral: so now if i make changes to my project code, I should not restart using pm2

GitHub Copilot: If you're using the `--watch` flag with PM2, it will automatically restart your application whenever a file changes in the current directory or its subdirectories. This means that, in most cases, you won't need to manually restart your application after making changes to the code.

However, there are some cases where you might still need to manually restart your application:

1. **Changes to environment variables:** If you're using environment variables and you change their values, you'll need to manually restart your application for the new values to take effect.

2. **Changes to the `node_modules` directory:** By default, PM2's watch feature ignores the `node_modules` directory. If you install a new package or update an existing one, you'll need to manually restart your application.

3. **Changes to the build process:** If you make changes to your build process (like modifying your Webpack configuration), you'll need to manually rebuild your application and then restart it.

In these cases, you can use the `pm2 restart "auto-sms"` command to manually restart your application.

Ewooral: i am getting the below error when i accessed the next url
502 Bad Gateway
nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)

GitHub Copilot: A "502 Bad Gateway" error typically means that your Nginx server is acting as a reverse proxy and it's unable to get a valid or any response from the upstream server (in this case, your Next.js application).

Here are a few steps to debug this issue:

1. **Check if your Next.js application is running:** Use the `pm2 status` command to check if your application is running. If it's not, start it.

2. **Check the Nginx error logs:** The Nginx error logs can provide more details about what's causing the 502 error. On Ubuntu, the error logs are typically located at `/var/log/nginx/error.log`. You can view the most recent entries with the command `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`.

3. **Check your Nginx configuration:** Make sure that the `proxy_pass` directive in your Nginx configuration is pointing to the correct address and port for your Next.js application. The configuration file is typically located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` or `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

4. **Check if the port specified in the Nginx configuration is open and listening:** Use the `netstat` command to check if your application is running and listening on the correct port. The command `sudo netstat -plnt` will show you all the listening ports and their associated processes.

After checking these, if you find any misconfigurations, correct them and then restart Nginx using `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.

Ewooral: why do i get the below error when i hosted the next app that consumes the rust api on  vercel?

Blocked loading mixed active content “http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/greet/morning/Esi”

GitHub Copilot: The error "Blocked loading mixed active content" occurs when a website served over HTTPS tries to load a resource (like an API) over HTTP. This is blocked by browsers because it's a security risk. 

In your case, your Next.js app is served over HTTPS (since it's hosted on Vercel, which enforces HTTPS), but it's trying to load an API from your EC2 instance over HTTP. 

To resolve this issue, you need to serve your API over HTTPS. This involves getting an SSL certificate for your EC2 instance and configuring your server to use HTTPS. 

Here are the general steps:

1. **Get an SSL certificate:** You can get a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. You'll need to prove that you control the domain (or subdomain) for which you're requesting the certificate.

2. **Install the SSL certificate on your EC2 instance:** This involves copying the certificate files to your EC2 instance and configuring your server to use them. The exact steps depend on what server software you're using.

3. **Update your API URLs to use HTTPS:** In your Next.js app, update the URLs for your API to use `https://` instead of `http://`.

Please note that setting up HTTPS can be complex, especially if you're not familiar with server administration. If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, you might want to consider using a service that handles it for you, or hiring a professional to do it.

Ewooral: does the amazon ip address for my app below support free ssl certificate
http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000

GitHub Copilot: Let's Encrypt, which provides free SSL certificates, requires a domain name for issuing certificates. They do not issue certificates for raw IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instance URLs (like `ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com`).

To use a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt, you would need to:

1. **Purchase a domain name:** You can purchase a domain name from any domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or even Amazon's own Route 53 service.

2. **Point your domain to your EC2 instance:** You would need to create a DNS record (usually an A record or CNAME record) that points your domain name to your EC2 instance's public IP address.

3. **Issue the SSL certificate:** Once your domain is pointing to your EC2 instance, you can then use Let's Encrypt to issue an SSL certificate for your domain.

4. **Install the SSL certificate on your server:** After you've obtained the SSL certificate, you would need to install it on your server. The exact steps for this depend on what server software you're using.

5. **Update your application to use the new domain:** Finally, you would need to update your application to use the new domain (with HTTPS) instead of the raw EC2 instance URL.

Remember, using HTTPS is important for security, especially if your application handles sensitive data. It encrypts the data between the client and the server, preventing it from being read or modified by anyone else.

Ewooral: so nothing can be done about it except to purchase the domain ?

GitHub Copilot: Unfortunately, to use HTTPS and SSL, you do need a domain name. This is because the SSL certificate, which enables HTTPS, needs to be issued for a specific domain. 

However, there are some alternatives to purchasing a domain:

1. **Use a free domain:** Some services offer free subdomains. However, these are typically not recommended for professional or production applications, as they can have limitations and may not look as professional.

2. **Use a dynamic DNS service:** Some dynamic DNS services offer free subdomains and support for SSL. This could be a good option if you're running a small personal project or just testing things out.

3. **Use a platform that provides a domain and SSL:** Some hosting platforms, like Vercel or Netlify, provide a free subdomain and automatically handle SSL for you. However, these platforms might not support all types of applications.

Remember, using a domain name and SSL is not just about avoiding errors. It's also important for the security of your application and the trust of your users. If your application handles sensitive data, using HTTPS is crucial.

Ewooral: does aws provide any of the options above?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, AWS provides services that can help with this:

1. **Amazon Route 53:** This is AWS's domain registration service. You can purchase a domain name directly from AWS with this service. Once you have a domain, you can use Route 53 to create DNS records that point to your EC2 instance.

2. **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** This service provides free SSL/TLS certificates to AWS customers. These certificates can be used with many AWS services including Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront, and more. However, please note that these certificates cannot be downloaded and used on an EC2 instance directly. They are meant to be used with other AWS services that support ACM.

3. **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):** If you're running your application on multiple EC2 instances for high availability, you can use an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across your instances. You can associate an ACM certificate with your load balancer to serve your application over HTTPS.

4. **Amazon CloudFront:** This is a content delivery network (CDN) service that can serve your application to your users from data centers all over the world. You can associate an ACM certificate with your CloudFront distribution to serve your application over HTTPS.

Remember, there are costs associated with using these AWS services. Be sure to check the pricing details for each service before you start using them.

Ewooral: I mean does aws provide free tier domain names

GitHub Copilot: No, AWS does not provide free domain names, even under the free tier. Domain registration through Amazon Route 53 is a paid service. The cost varies depending on the top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org, .io) that you choose. 

While AWS does provide a lot of services in their free tier (like certain usage levels of EC2, S3, and Lambda), domain registration is not one of them. 

If cost is a concern, you might want to look into domain registrars that offer cheaper rates. However, keep in mind that a domain is often a key part of your online identity, so it's usually worth investing in a good one.

Ewooral:  sudo nginx -t

2024/05/18 13:31:48 [warn] 7470#7470: conflicting server name "16.171.1.163" on 0.0.0.0:80, ignored
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful


GitHub Copilot: The warning "conflicting server name" means that you have multiple Nginx server blocks (also known as virtual hosts) that are using the same `server_name` directive. In your case, it appears that "16.171.1.163" is being used in more than one server block.

The `server_name` directive is used to determine which server block should handle a given request, based on the `Host` header field of the request. If multiple server blocks have the same `server_name`, Nginx will use the first one it encounters and ignore the rest, hence the warning.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that each of your server blocks has a unique `server_name`. If you have multiple server blocks that need to handle requests for the same `server_name`, you should merge them into a single server block.

Here's how you can check your Nginx configuration:

1. Open your Nginx configuration file. This is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, or it could be in a separate file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory.

2. Look for `server` blocks in the configuration file. These are denoted by lines starting with `server {` and ending with `}`.

3. Inside each `server` block, look for the `server_name` directive. This should be followed by a domain name or IP address.

4. Ensure that each `server_name` is unique across all server blocks.

After making any necessary changes, you can check your configuration again with `sudo nginx -t`. If the configuration is correct, you can reload Nginx with `sudo systemctl reload nginx` to apply the changes.

- `pts/0`: This is the terminal where the process is running.
- `S+`: This is the process state code. `S` means the process is in interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete), and `+` means the process is in the foreground process group.
- `13:32`: This is the time when the process started.
- `0:00`: This is the total CPU time that the process has used.
- `grep --color=auto cargo`: This is the command that was run.

In this case, the only process that matches `cargo` is the `grep` command itself. This means there are currently no running processes related to `cargo`.

Ewooral: how do i remove one completely from amazon instance expecially the nextjs app

GitHub Copilot: To completely remove a Next.js application from an Amazon EC2 instance, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **SSH into your EC2 instance:** You can do this using the `ssh` command from your terminal. You'll need your EC2 instance's public IP address and the private key file for your instance. The command would look something like this:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ubuntu@your.ec2.ip.address
```

2. **Navigate to the directory where your Next.js application is located:** Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if your application is in a directory called `my-app` in your home directory, you would use:

```bash
cd ~/my-app
```

3. **Delete the application directory:** Use the `rm` command to delete the directory and all of its contents. Be careful with this command, as it will permanently delete the specified files and directories. For example:

```bash
rm -rf ~/my-app
```

4. **Stop any running processes related to the application:** If you're running your Next.js application as a service or using a process manager like PM2, you'll need to stop it. For example, if you're using PM2, you could use:

```bash
pm2 stop my-app
pm2 delete my-app
```

5. **Remove any related configuration:** If you've set up any server configuration related to your Next.js application (like Nginx reverse proxy settings), you'll want to remove or update those as well.

Remember to replace `my-app` and `/path/to/your/key.pem` with your actual application directory and key file path. Also, the username `ubuntu` is common for EC2 instances, but it might be different for your instance.

Ewooral: but you said earlier that the nohup thing will the keep our rust api process running till we decide to stop it. so why is it not running

GitHub Copilot: The `nohup` command allows a process to keep running after the shell session has ended. However, there are several reasons why the process might not be running anymore:

1. **The process crashed:** If there was an unhandled error in your Rust API, it could have caused the process to crash.

2. **The system rebooted:** If your EC2 instance was rebooted for any reason, processes not configured to start on boot would have been stopped.

3. **Out of resources:** If your system ran out of resources (like memory), it might have killed the process.

To investigate why the process stopped, you can check the `nohup.out` file in the directory where you ran the `nohup` command. This file contains the output of the process, including any error messages that were printed when the process stopped.

To ensure your Rust API starts on boot and restarts if it crashes, you might want to consider using a process manager like systemd or Supervisor. These tools provide more robust process management features than `nohup`, including automatic restarts and log management.

Ewooral: lets use systemd rather

GitHub Copilot: To use systemd to manage your Rust API, you can create a systemd service file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create a new systemd service file:** This file will tell systemd how to start and manage your Rust API. Use the `sudo` command to create a new file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my-rust-api.service
```

2. **Add the following content to the service file:** Replace `/path/to/your/rust-api` with the actual path to your Rust API executable.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Rust API
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/rust-api
User=

ubuntu


Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. **Save and close the file:** If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. **Reload the systemd daemon:** This will make systemd aware of your new service.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

5. **Start your Rust API service:** This will start your Rust API now.

```bash
sudo systemctl start my-rust-api
```

6. **Enable your Rust API service to start on boot:** This will ensure your Rust API starts automatically whenever your EC2 instance is rebooted.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable my-rust-api
```

Now, your Rust API will be managed by systemd. It will start on boot, and if it crashes, systemd will automatically restart it. You can check the status of your service at any time with `sudo systemctl status my-rust-api`.

Ewooral: is my-rust-api name the name of my project directory

GitHub Copilot: No, `my-rust-api` in the context of the systemd service file is just the name of the service as systemd will recognize it. It doesn't have to match the name of your project directory. You can name it anything you like, but it's a good practice to name it something descriptive and related to the service it represents.

The path `/path/to/your/rust-api` should be replaced with the actual path to the executable file of your Rust application. If you're using Cargo to build your Rust application, this is typically located in the `target/release/` directory inside your project directory.

For example, if your project directory is `/home/ubuntu/my-rust-api`, and you have a release build of your application, the path to the executable might be `/home/ubuntu/my-rust-api/target/release/my-rust-api`. This is the path you would use in the `ExecStart` line of the systemd service file.

Ewooral: I had the error below, could it be because we've used nohup for the configuration before or what could the error be

GitHub Copilot: The error message `code=exited, status=203/EXEC` typically indicates that systemd is unable to execute the command specified in the `ExecStart` directive of the service file. This could be due to a number of reasons:

1. **Incorrect path:** The path to the executable in the `ExecStart` directive is incorrect. Double-check the path and make sure it points to the correct executable file.

2. **Missing executable permissions:** The file specified in `ExecStart` does not have executable permissions. You can add executable permissions to a file with the command `chmod +x /path/to/your/file`.

3. **Wrong user:** The user specified in the `User` directive does not have the necessary permissions to execute the file. If you're not sure which user should run the service, you can try removing the `User` directive altogether to run the service as root.

4. **Environment issues:** The environment in which systemd is trying to run the executable is missing some necessary variables or settings. This could be the case if your application requires certain environment variables to be set.

To debug this issue, you can check the logs for your service with the command `journalctl -u my-rust-api`. This will show you the output of your service, which might include error messages that can help you diagnose the problem.

GitHub Copilot: The log messages indicate that the service is starting but immediately exiting with the status code `203/EXEC`. This typically means that the executable specified in the `ExecStart` directive of the systemd service file cannot be executed.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the path to the executable:** Make sure the path specified in the `ExecStart` directive of the systemd service file is correct. You can check this by running the command directly in the terminal. For example, if your `ExecStart` directive is `ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/rust-api-with-rocket/target/release/my-rust-api`, you can try running `/home/ubuntu/rust-api-with-rocket/target/release/my-rust-api` directly in the terminal to see if it works.

2. **Check the permissions of the executable:** Make sure the executable has the correct permissions. It should be executable by the user that the service is running as. You can check the permissions with `ls -l /path/to/your/executable` and set the executable permission with `chmod +x /path/to/your/executable`.

3. **Check the user of the service:** If you have specified a `User` directive in your systemd service file, make sure this user has the necessary permissions to access and execute the file. If you're not sure, you can try removing the `User` directive to run the service as root.

After making any changes to the systemd service file, remember to reload the systemd daemon with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` before trying to start the service again.

Ewooral: sudo lsof -i :8000
[1]+  Exit 101                nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1


GitHub Copilot: The `lsof -i :8000` command lists all processes that are using the network port 8000. If there's no output from this command, it means no process is currently using this port.

The message `[1]+ Exit 101 nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1` is not related to the `lsof` command. This is a message from the shell indicating that a background process has exited. The `Exit 101` part indicates that the process exited with status code 101.

If you were trying to run your Rust API with `nohup cargo run --release > output.log 2>&1` and it exited with status code 101, there was likely an error. You can check the `output.log` file to see if there are any error messages that might help you diagnose the problem.

If you're trying to start your Rust API with systemd and it's not working, make sure no other process is using the port that your Rust API is trying to bind to. You can do this with the `lsof -i :8000` command. If this command shows any processes, you can stop them with the `kill` command. Once the port is free, try starting your Rust API with systemd again.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `code=exited, status=101` indicates that the `cargo run --release` command exited with status code 101. This is a common exit code for Rust programs that have panicked.

Here are a few things you can do to debug this issue:

1. **Check the output of the service:** Use the `journalctl -u my-rust-api` command to check the output of the service. This might include error messages from your Rust application that can help you diagnose the problem.

2. **Run the command manually:** Try running the `cargo run --release` command manually in the terminal. This will run your Rust application in the foreground and print its output to the terminal, which might include error messages.

3. **Check the Rust code:** If your Rust application is panicking, there might be an unhandled error in your code. Look for any `unwrap()` or `expect()` calls in your code that might be causing the panic, and make sure all errors are properly handled.

Remember, running `cargo run --release` as a service in production is not recommended. You should build your application with `cargo build --release` and then run the resulting binary directly. This will give you better performance and more control over how your application is run.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `Address already in use (os error 98)` indicates that the port 8000, which your Rust API server is trying to bind to, is already in use by another process.

You can find out which process is using port 8000 with the following command:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8000
```

This will list all processes that are using port 8000. If you find a process that shouldn't be using the port, you can stop it with the `kill` command.

If you can't stop the other process or if it's necessary for it to use port 8000, you'll need to configure your Rust API server to use a different port. You can usually do this with a configuration file or an environment variable, but the exact method depends on how your Rust API server is set up.

Once you've freed up port 8000 or configured your Rust API server to use a different port, try starting the service again with `sudo systemctl start my-rust-api`.

Ewooral: how do i check service status with systemctl

GitHub Copilot: You can check the status of a service with `systemctl` using the `status` command followed by the name of the service. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
sudo systemctl status my-rust-api
```

Replace `my-rust-api` with the name of your service. This command will show you whether the service is running, stopped, or in any other state. It will also show you the most recent log entries for the service, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

Ewooral: show me how to do the below instruction you gave me
Remember, running cargo run --release as a service in production is not recommended. You should build your application with cargo build --release and then run the resulting binary directly. This will give you better performance and more control over how your application is run.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can do it:

1. **Build your application:** Run the following command in the terminal in the directory of your Rust project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will create an optimized binary for your application in the `target/release` directory.

2. **Update the systemd service file:** Open the systemd service file for your application (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/my-rust-api.service`) and update the `ExecStart` directive to point to the binary you just built. For example:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/project/target/release/my-rust-api
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your Rust project.

3. **Reload the systemd daemon:** After making changes to the systemd service file, you need to reload the systemd daemon to apply the changes. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. **Start your service:** Now you can start your service with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start my-rust-api
```

Replace `my-rust-api` with the name of your service.

5. **Check the status of your service:** You can check the status of your service to make sure it's running with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status my-rust-api
```

Replace `my-rust-api` with the name of your service.

Ewooral: below is my-rust-api.service file code

Make the necessary changes

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can modify your `my-rust-api.service` file to run the binary directly:

```ini

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

In the `ExecStart` line, replace `my-rust-api` with the name of your binary. You can find this in the `target/release` directory after running `cargo build --release`. 

Remember to reload the systemd daemon and restart your service after making these changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart my-rust-api
```

build  deps  examples  incremental  rust_rocket_api  rust_rocket_api.d


GitHub Copilot: It seems like the name of your binary is `rust_rocket_api`, not `my-rust-api`. You should use this name in your systemd service file. Here's the updated file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Rust API Server
After=

network

.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
# Replace with the user running your Rust app
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/rust-api-with-rocket
# Adjust path
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/rust-api-with-rocket/target/release/rust_rocket_api
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After updating the file, remember to reload the systemd daemon and restart your service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart my-rust-api
```

Ewooral: what about this command below
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env cargo run --release


GitHub Copilot: The `ExecStart=/usr/bin/env cargo run --release` command in your systemd service file is used to start your Rust application. It's using `cargo run --release` to build and run your application.

However, as mentioned earlier, it's better to build your application with `cargo build --release` and then run the resulting binary directly. This gives you better performance and more control over how your application is run.

So, you should replace this line with the path to your built binary. In your case, the binary is named `rust_rocket_api` and is located in the `/home/ubuntu/rust-api-with-rocket/target/release/` directory. So the line should be:

```ini
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/rust-api-with-rocket/target/release/rust_rocket_api
```

This tells systemd to run the `rust_rocket_api` binary directly when starting your service.

Ewooral: so with this change, any time i make changes to my code, what do i do to make the changes reflect on the instance url

GitHub Copilot: When you make changes to your code, you'll need to rebuild your application and restart the service for the changes to take effect. Here are the steps:

1. **Rebuild your application:** Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to build your application:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will create a new binary in the `target/release` directory.

2. **Restart the service:** After rebuilding your application, you need to restart the service for the changes to take effect. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart my-rust-api
```

Replace `my-rust-api` with the name of your service.

Remember, you need to do these steps every time you make changes to your code and want those changes to be reflected in the running application.

Ewooral: with the below rest api, in rust, update it to support update and delete methods and also create a handler function that updates, posts and deletes using any brilliant usecase you can think of

#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
extern crate rocket_cors;

use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedHeaders, AllowedOrigins};

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
"This is Elijah, my first api project in rust using the rocket framework!"
}

#[get("/greet//")]

}

    allowed_methods: vec![Method::Get, Method::Post].into_iter().map(From::from).collect(),
    allowed_headers: AllowedHeaders::some(&["Authorization", "Accept"]),
    allow_credentials: true,
    ..Default::default()
};

rocket::ignite()
    .mount("/", routes![index, greet])
    .attach(options)
    .launch();

    

GitHub Copilot: To support `PUT` (update) and `DELETE` methods, you need to add these methods to the `allowed_methods` vector in your CORS options. You also need to create handler functions for these methods. 

For this example, let's create a simple in-memory store for messages. We'll use a `HashMap` where the key is the message ID and the value is the message content. We'll create `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` handlers for creating, updating, and deleting messages.

Here's how you can do it:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
extern crate rocket_cors;

use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::collections::HashMap;

use rocket::State;
use rocket::http::Method;
use rocket_cors::{AllowedHeaders, AllowedOrigins};
use rocket_contrib::json::Json;

#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct Message {
    id: String,
    content: String,
}

type MessageMap = Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "This is Elijah, my first api project in rust using the rocket framework!"
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> String {
    format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name)
}

#[post("/message", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn post_message(message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Json<Message> {
    map.lock().unwrap().insert(message.id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    message
}

#[put("/message/<id>", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn update_message(id: String, message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Option<Json<Message>> {
    map.lock().unwrap().insert(id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    Some(message)
}

#[delete("/message/<id>")]
fn delete_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Option<Json<Message>> {
    map.lock().unwrap().remove(&id);
    None
}

fn main() {
    let (allowed_origins, failed_origins) = AllowedOrigins::some(&[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000",
        // "http://your_nextjs_app_origin",
    ]);
    assert!(failed_origins.is_empty());

    let options = rocket_cors::Cors {
        allowed_origins,
        allowed_methods: vec![Method::Get, Method::Post, Method::Put, Method::Delete].into_iter().map(From::from).collect(),
        allowed_headers: AllowedHeaders::some(&["Authorization", "Accept"]),
        allow_credentials: true,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    rocket::ignite()
        .mount("/", routes![index, greet, post_message, update_message, delete_message])
        .manage(Mutex::new(HashMap::<String, String>::new()))
        .attach(options)
        .launch();
}
```

This code creates a simple REST API for messages. You can create a message with a `POST` request to `/message`, update a message with a `PUT` request to `/message/<id>`, and delete a message with a `DELETE` request to `/message/<id>`. The message data is sent and received as JSON.

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any error handling or validation. In a real-world application, you would want to add these, as well as use a persistent storage system instead of an in-memory `HashMap`.

Ewooral: so how do i test it with thunder client

GitHub Copilot: Thunder Client is a REST API Client for Visual Studio Code. Here's how you can test the API endpoints:

1. **Install Thunder Client:** If you haven't already, install Thunder Client from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

2. **Create a new request:** Click on the Thunder Client icon in the activity bar on the side of Visual Studio Code. Click on the "New Request" button.

3. **Set the request method and URL:** In the new request tab, select the method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the dropdown menu and enter the URL of your API endpoint.

4. **Set the request body (for POST and PUT requests):** If you're testing a POST or PUT request, you need to set the request body. Click on the "Body" tab below the URL field, select "JSON" from the dropdown menu, and enter your JSON data. For example:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "content": "Hello, world!"
}
```

5. **Send the request:** Click on the "Send" button to send the request. The response will be displayed in the panel below.

6. **Repeat for other endpoints:** Repeat these steps for each of your API endpoints.

Remember to replace the URL and JSON data with your actual API URL and data.

Ewooral: provide test for all the endpoints

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can test each endpoint using Thunder Client:

1. **GET /:** This is a simple GET request. Set the method to GET and the URL to your API's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`). Click "Send" to send the request.

2. **GET /greet/{greeting}/{name}:** This is a GET request with path parameters. Set the method to GET and the URL to your API's base URL followed by `/greet/{greeting}/{name}`, replacing `{greeting}` and `{name}` with your desired values (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/greet/Hello/World`). Click "Send" to send the request.

3. **POST /message:** This is a POST request with a JSON body. Set the method to POST and the URL to your API's base URL followed by `/message` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/message`). Click on the "Body" tab, select "JSON" from the dropdown menu, and enter your JSON data:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "content": "Hello, world!"
}
```

Click "Send" to send the request.

4. **PUT /message/{id}:** This is a PUT request with a JSON body. Set the method to PUT and the URL to your API's base URL followed by `/message/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the message you want to update (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/message/1`). Click on the "Body" tab, select "JSON" from the dropdown menu, and enter your JSON data:

```json
{
    "content": "Updated message"
}
```

Click "Send" to send the request.

5. **DELETE /message/{id}:** This is a DELETE request. Set the method to DELETE and the URL to your API's base URL followed by `/message/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the message you want to delete (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/message/1`). Click "Send" to send the request.

Remember to replace the URLs and JSON data with your actual API URL and data.

Ewooral: DELETE /message/1 application/json:
    => Matched: DELETE /message/<id> (delete_message)
    => Warning: Response was `None`.
    => Outcome: Failure
    => Warning: Responding with 404 Not Found catcher.
    => Response succeeded.

GitHub Copilot: The log message you're seeing indicates that the DELETE request for `/message/1` did not find a message with the ID of `1` to delete. The `delete_message` function is designed to return `None` when a message is successfully deleted, but if there's no message with the given ID to begin with, Rocket's default behavior is to treat the `None` response as a 404 Not Found error.

If you want to change this behavior, you could modify the `delete_message` function to always return a successful response, even if no message was found. Here's an example of how you could do this:

```rust
#[delete("/message/<id>")]
fn delete_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Json<Value> {
    map.lock().unwrap().remove(&id);
    Json(json!({"status": "success"}))
}
```

In this version of the function, we're always returning a JSON response with a `status` field set to `"success"`. This way, you'll always get a 200 OK response when you send a DELETE request, regardless of whether a message with the given ID existed or not.

Ewooral: cannot find value `static_rocket_route_info_for_static_rocket_route_info_for_update_message` in this scope
not found in this scoperustcC

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing typically occurs when the Rust compiler cannot find a function or variable in the current scope. In this case, it seems to be related to the `update_message` function.

The error might be due to a typo in the function name or in the routes array in the `rocket::ignite().mount()` function. Make sure the function is defined in your code and that it's correctly referenced in your routes.

Here's how the `update_message` function and its route should look:

```rust
#[put("/message/<id>", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn update_message(id: String, message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Option<Json<Message>> {
    map.lock().unwrap().insert(id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    Some(message)
}

// ...

rocket::ignite()
    .mount("/", routes![index, greet, post_message, update_message, delete_message])
    .manage(Mutex::new(HashMap::<String, String>::new()))
    .attach(options)
    .launch();
```

If the function and its route are correctly defined and you're still seeing the error, there might be another issue in your code. Please provide more context or the complete error message for further assistance.

        .attach(options)
        .launch();
}

the delete_message in the .mount is causing the error

GitHub Copilot: The error is due to the missing route attribute `#[delete("/message/<id>")]` above the `delete_message` function. The route attribute is necessary to tell Rocket that this function should be used to handle DELETE requests to the `/message/<id>` path.

Here's how you can fix it:

```rust
#[delete("/message/<id>")]
fn delete_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> JsonValue {
    map.lock().unwrap().remove(&id);
    JsonValue(json!({"status": "success"}).into())
}
```

With this change, the `delete_message` function should now be correctly registered as a route handler for DELETE requests to `/message/<id>`.

Ewooral: create a function handler that reads a content or message

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can create a function handler that reads a message by its ID:

```rust
#[get("/message/<id>")]
fn get_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Option<Json<Message>> {
    let hashmap = map.lock().unwrap();
    hashmap.get(&id).map(|content| {
        Json(Message {
            id: id.clone(),
            content: content.clone(),
        })
    })
}
```

This function is a route handler for GET requests to `/message/<id>`. It retrieves the message with the given ID from the shared state hashmap. If a message with the given ID exists, it returns the message as JSON. If no such message exists, it returns `None`, which Rocket will automatically convert into a 404 Not Found response.

Don't forget to add `get_message` to your routes in the `rocket::ignite().mount()` function:

```rust
rocket::ignite()
    .mount("/", routes![index, greet, post_message, update_message, delete_message, get_message])
    .manage(Mutex::new(HashMap::<String, String>::new()))
    .attach(options)
    .launch();
```

Remember to replace `MessageMap` and `Message` with your actual types if they're different.

Ewooral: now, with the above changes, lets test the endpoints after that explain briefly what endpoint, api and route handler function is with the above code as a guide

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's test the endpoints:

1. **GET /:** This endpoint returns a static string. You can test it by sending a GET request to your base URL.

2. **GET /greet/{greeting}/{name}:** This endpoint returns a personalized greeting. You can test it by sending a GET request to your base URL followed by `/greet/{greeting}/{name}`, replacing `{greeting}` and `{name}` with your desired values.

3. **POST /message:** This endpoint creates a new message. You can test it by sending a POST request to your base URL followed by `/message`, with a JSON body containing the `id` and `content` of the new message.

4. **PUT /message/{id}:** This endpoint updates an existing message. You can test it by sending a PUT request to your base URL followed by `/message/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the message you want to update, with a JSON body containing the new `content`.

5. **DELETE /message/{id}:** This endpoint deletes an existing message. You can test it by sending a DELETE request to your base URL followed by `/message/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the message you want to delete.

6. **GET /message/{id}:** This endpoint retrieves an existing message. You can test it by sending a GET request to your base URL followed by `/message/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the message you want to retrieve.

Now, let's explain the terms:

- **Endpoint:** An endpoint is a specific URL where your API can be accessed. In the context of the above code, each function decorated with a method attribute (like `#[get("/")]` or `#[post("/message")]`) defines an endpoint.

- **API:** An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines methods of communication between various software components. In this case, your API is the entire application, including all of its endpoints.

- **Route Handler Function:** A route handler function is a function that's executed when a specific endpoint is hit. In the context of the above code, functions like `index`, `greet`, `post_message`, `update_message`, `delete_message`, and `get_message` are all route handler functions. They handle requests to their respective endpoints and return responses.

Ewooral: so with the below
which is the endpoint and which is the handler
#[get("/message/<id>")]
fn get_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Option<Json<Message>> {
    let hashmap = map.lock().unwrap();
    hashmap.get(&id).map(|content| {
        Json(Message {
            id: id.clone(),
            content: content.clone(),
        })
    })
}

GitHub Copilot: In the provided code:

- The **endpoint** is `/message/<id>`. This is the URL path that the API responds to. The `<id>` part is a variable parameter, meaning it can be replaced with any value when making a request.

- The **handler** is the `get_message` function. This is the function that gets executed when a GET request is made to the `/message/<id>` endpoint. It takes the `id` from the URL, retrieves the corresponding message from the shared state hashmap, and returns it as JSON. If no such message exists, it returns `None`, which Rocket will automatically convert into a 404 Not Found response.

Ewooral: with the testing, provide code where neccessary

GitHub Copilot: To test the endpoints, you can use a tool like `curl` from the command line, or a GUI tool like Postman. Here are some examples using `curl`:

1. **GET /:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

2. **GET /greet/{greeting}/{name}:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/greet/Hello/World
```

3. **POST /message:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1","content":"Hello, World!"}' http://localhost:8000/message
```

4. **PUT /message/{id}:**

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content":"Hello, Universe!"}' http://localhost:8000/message/1
```

5. **DELETE /message/{id}:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/message/1
```

6. **GET /message/{id}:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/message/1
```

Replace `localhost:8000` with your actual server address and port, and replace the `id` and `content` values with your actual test data.

Ewooral: use thunder client rather than curl

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can test the endpoints using Thunder Client, an extension for Visual Studio Code:

1. **GET /:**
   - Method: GET
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/

2. **GET /greet/{greeting}/{name}:**
   - Method: GET
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/greet/Hello/World

3. **POST /message:**
   - Method: POST
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/message
   - Headers: Key = Content-Type, Value = application/json
   - Body: 
     ```json
     {
       "id":"1",
       "content":"Hello, World!"
     }
     ```

4. **PUT /message/{id}:**
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/message/1
   - Headers: Key = Content-Type, Value = application/json
   - Body: 
     ```json
     {
       "content":"Hello, Universe!"
     }
     ```

5. **DELETE /message/{id}:**
   - Method: DELETE
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/message/1

6. **GET /message/{id}:**
   - Method: GET
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/message/1

Replace `localhost:8000` with your actual server address and port, and replace the `id` and `content` values with your actual test data.

Ewooral: axum and rocket, which one is easy and syntax friendly

GitHub Copilot: Both Axum and Rocket are popular web frameworks in Rust, and each has its own strengths and design philosophies.

**Rocket** is known for its ease of use and developer-friendly features. It provides a macro-based syntax that is easy to read and write. It's designed to guide developers to write robust, secure web applications without needing to worry about the details of HTTP. Rocket's syntax is quite unique and might feel more "magical", but it's very expressive and ergonomic.

```rust
#[get("/hello/<name>")]
fn hello(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

**Axum**, on the other hand, is a newer framework that focuses on the principles of type safety and modularity. It's built on top of Tokio and Hyper, and it uses a more functional style, which might appeal to those who prefer explicit over implicit. Axum's syntax might feel more verbose, but it's very explicit and flexible.

```rust
async fn hello(
    Path(name): Path<String>,
) -> impl IntoResponse {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name).into_response()
}
```

In terms of ease and syntax friendliness, it largely depends on your personal preference and familiarity with Rust. If you prefer a more declarative, macro-based style, you might find Rocket easier to use. If you prefer a more explicit, functional style, you might find Axum more to your liking. Both are excellent choices for building web applications in Rust.

Ewooral: how about actix web

GitHub Copilot: **Actix-web** is another popular web framework in Rust. It's known for its high performance and its actor model, which can make concurrent programming easier and safer.

Actix-web uses a more traditional function-based routing system, which some developers might find more straightforward and less "magical" than Rocket's macro-based system. It also provides a lot of flexibility and control, which can be a benefit for complex applications.

Here's an example of a route in Actix-web:

```rust
async fn index(info: web::Path<(String,)>) -> impl Responder {
    format!("Hello, {}!", info.0)
}

// In the main function
HttpServer::new(|| {
    App::new().route("/hello/{name}", web::get().to(index))
})
.bind("127.0.0.1:8000")?
.run()
.await?;
```

In terms of ease and syntax friendliness, Actix-web might have a steeper learning curve than Rocket, especially for developers who are new to Rust or not familiar with the actor model. However, it's a powerful and flexible framework that can be a good choice for high-performance or complex applications.

Ewooral: what is the actor model

GitHub Copilot: The actor model is a conceptual model to deal with concurrent computation. It defines some general rules for how the system's components should behave and interact with each other.

In the actor model, everything is an "actor". An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:

1. Send a finite number of messages to other actors.
2. Create a finite number of new actors.
3. Designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.

There is no shared state in the actor model. Instead, each actor has its own private state, and the only way to observe or influence an actor's state is by sending messages. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the system and avoid common concurrency problems like race conditions.

Actix is a Rust library for building concurrent systems based on the actor model. In Actix, each actor runs in its own thread and communicates with other actors through message passing. This can make it easier to build safe, concurrent applications in Rust.













Ewooral: lets use usequery for this action

GitHub Copilot: Sure, we can use the `useQuery` hook from the `react-query` library to fetch data. Here's how you can refactor your code:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

function MyComponent() {
  const fetchGreeting = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/greet/morning/Esi");
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    const data = await response.text();
    return JSON.parse(data);
  };

  const { data, error, isLoading, isError } = useQuery('fetchGreeting', fetchGreeting);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, `useQuery` is used to fetch data from the server. The first argument to `useQuery` is a unique key for the query, and the second argument is an asynchronous function that returns the data. The `useQuery` hook returns an object with fields that provide information about the state of the query, such as whether it is loading, if there was an error, and the data itself.

Ewooral: lets use axios rather

GitHub Copilot: Sure, we can replace the `fetch` API with `axios`. Here's how you can refactor your code:

```tsx
import axios from 'axios';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

function MyComponent() {
  const fetchGreeting = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get("http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/greet/morning/Esi");
    return response.data;
  };

  const { data, error, isLoading, isError } = useQuery('fetchGreeting', fetchGreeting);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, `axios.get` is used to fetch data from the server. The `axios.get` method returns a promise that resolves to the response object, which contains the data returned from the server. The `response.data` property contains the actual data.

Ewooral: what is the essence of the usequery key 

GitHub Copilot: The `queryKey` in `useQuery` is a unique identifier for the query. It is used by `react-query` to manage and cache the query in memory. 

When you provide a `queryKey`, `react-query` will use it to look up in its cache before making a new request. If the data for the `queryKey` is already in the cache and is fresh (not stale), `react-query` will return the cached data instead of making a new request.

In your code, the `queryKey` is `["greeting"]`. This means that the result of the `fetchGreeting` function will be cached under this key. If you call `useQuery` with the same `queryKey` elsewhere in your application, `react-query` will use the cached data instead of making a new request, as long as the data is not stale.

The `queryKey` can also be an array, which is useful when you need to pass parameters to your query function. For example, if your `fetchGreeting` function accepted a `name` parameter, you could use `queryKey: ['greeting', name]`. This would create a unique cache entry for each name.

Ewooral: does it work just like how useCallback or useMemo work

GitHub Copilot: The `useQuery` hook from `react-query` does have some similarities with `useCallback` and `useMemo` from React, but they serve different purposes and work in different ways.

`useCallback` and `useMemo` are React hooks that are used to optimize performance in React applications by preventing unnecessary re-renders or recalculations.

- `useCallback` returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
- `useMemo` returns a memoized value that only recomputes if one of the dependencies has changed.

On the other hand, `useQuery` is a hook from `react-query` that is used for fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in React applications.

- `useQuery` accepts a query key and an async function that fetches data, and returns an object that contains the status and result of the query. It also provides features like automatic refetching when the data becomes stale, and caching of query results.

So while they all involve some form of memoization or caching, they are used for different things. `useCallback` and `useMemo` are used for optimizing performance in React, while `useQuery` is used for managing server state in `react-query`.

Ewooral: provide error handling feature for the api please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can add error handling to your `fetchGreeting` function and also handle the error state in your component. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const fetchGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get("http://ec2-16-171-1-163.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/");
      console.log("response:: ", response.data)
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching greeting: ", error);
      throw error;
    }
  };

  const { data, error, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["greeting"],
    queryFn: fetchGreeting,
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  // Rest of your component
}
```

In this code, I've added a `try/catch` block around the `axios.get` call in `fetchGreeting` to catch any errors that occur when fetching the greeting. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console and then re-thrown so that `react-query` can catch it and set the `isError` and `error` states.

In the component, I've added a check for `isError` after the check for `isLoading`. If an error occurred, a div is rendered that displays the error message.

Ewooral: why the introduction of throw error, what role is it playing

GitHub Copilot: The `throw error` statement in the `catch` block is used to re-throw the caught error. This is useful in situations where you want to handle the error partially or log it in the catch block, but also want the error to propagate up the call stack.

In the context of `react-query` and the `useQuery` hook, throwing an error in the query function is how you communicate to `react-query` that the query has failed. When an error is thrown in the query function, `react-query` catches it and sets the `isError` and `error` states accordingly.

So, in your code, if an error occurs when making the `axios.get` request, it is caught and logged in the `catch` block, and then re-thrown with `throw error`. `react-query` then catches this error and sets the `isError` state to `true` and the `error` state to the caught error. This allows you to handle and display errors in your component.

Ewooral: so it means that when we don't throw error, the error will only be caught in the fetchgreeting function and not passed to react query to update the isError value?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. If you catch an error in the `fetchGreeting` function and don't re-throw it, `react-query` will not be aware of the error and will not set the `isError` state to `true`. 

This is because from `react-query`'s perspective, if the `fetchGreeting` function completes without throwing an error, it assumes the function was successful, regardless of what happened inside the function.

By re-throwing the error, you're signaling to `react-query` that something went wrong during the execution of the `fetchGreeting` function, and it should treat this execution as an error. This will cause `react-query` to set the `isError` state to `true` and the `error` state to the caught error, allowing you to handle and display the error in your component.

Ewooral: provide error handling feature for all the endpoints of  the rust api code selected please

GitHub Copilot: In Rust, error handling is typically done using the `Result` type. Here's how you can add error handling to your endpoints:

```rust
use rocket::http::Status;
use rocket::response::status;

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> Result<String, status::Custom<String>> {
    if greeting.is_empty() || name.is_empty() {
        Err(status::Custom(Status::BadRequest, "Greeting or name cannot be empty".into()))
    } else {
        Ok(format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name))
    }
}

#[post("/message", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn post_message(message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Result<Json<Message>, status::Custom<String>> {
    let mut map = map.lock().map_err(|_| status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
    map.insert(message.id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    Ok(message)
}

#[put("/message/<id>", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn update_message(id: String, message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Result<Option<Json<Message>>, status::Custom<String>> {
    let mut map = map.lock().map_err(|_| status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
    map.insert(id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    Ok(Some(message))
}
```

In this code, I've changed the return type of the endpoints to `Result<T, status::Custom<String>>`. This allows the endpoints to return either a successful result or an error.

In the `greet` endpoint, I've added a check to see if the `greeting` or `name` is empty. If either is empty, an error is returned with a status of `BadRequest` and a custom error message.

In the `post_message` and `update_message` endpoints, I've added error handling for the `map.lock()` call. If acquiring the lock fails, an error is returned with a status of `InternalServerError` and a custom error message.

Ewooral: so there is no try and catch to handle errors in rust, also provide error handling for all the endpoints. leave none unturnd

GitHub Copilot: In Rust, error handling is typically done using the `Result` type, which can be either `Ok` (indicating success) or `Err` (indicating failure). Here's how you can add error handling to all your endpoints:

```rust
#[get("/")]
fn index() -> Result<&'static str, status::Custom<String>> {
    Ok("This is Elijah, my first api project in rust using the rocket framework!")
}

#[get("/greet/<greeting>/<name>")]
fn greet(greeting: String, name: String) -> Result<String, status::Custom<String>> {
    if greeting.is_empty() || name.is_empty() {
        Err(status::Custom(Status::BadRequest, "Greeting or name cannot be empty".into()))
    } else {
        Ok(format!("Good {}, {}", greeting, name))
    }
}

#[post("/message", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn post_message(message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Result<Json<Message>, status::Custom<String>> {
    let mut map = map.lock().map_err(|_| status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
    map.insert(message.id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    Ok(message)
}

#[put("/message/<id>", format = "json", data = "<message>")]
fn update_message(id: String, message: Json<Message>, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Result<Option<Json<Message>>, status::Custom<String>> {
    let mut map = map.lock().map_err(|_| status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
    map.insert(id.clone(), message.content.clone());
    Ok(Some(message))
}

#[delete("/message/<id>")]
fn delete_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Result<JsonValue, status::Custom<String>> {
    let mut map = map.lock().map_err(|_| status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
    map.remove(&id);
    Ok(JsonValue(json!({"status": "success"}).into()))
}

#[get("/message/<id>")]
fn get_message(id: String, map: State<'_, MessageMap>) -> Result<Option<Json<Message>>, status::Custom<String>> {
    let hashmap = map.lock().map_err(|_| status::Custom(Status::InternalServerError, "Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
    let message = hashmap.get(&id).map(|content| {
        Json(Message {
            id: id.clone(),
            content: content.clone(),
        })
    });
    Ok(message)
}
```

In this code, I've changed the return type of all the endpoints to `Result<T, status::Custom<String>>`. This allows the endpoints to return either a successful result or an error.

In the `greet` endpoint, I've added a check to see if the `greeting` or `name` is empty. If either is empty, an error is returned with a status of `BadRequest` and a custom error message.

In the `post_message`, `update_message`, `delete_message`, and `get_message` endpoints, I've added error handling for the `map.lock()` call. If acquiring the lock fails, an error is returned with a status of `InternalServerError` and a custom error message.
